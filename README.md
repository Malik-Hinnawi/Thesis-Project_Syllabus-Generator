## Abstract:
This proposal introduces a domain agnostic hierarchical classification methodology to generate syllabi for computer science courses. First, it extracts the glossary part of the main book for the given course. It populates a seed knowledge graph using the extracted glossary. For each chapter, it enriches the layers of the knowledge graph by using a named entity recognition tool. It also assigns taxonomic relationships to the annotated entities with respect to the DBLP taxonomy. The overall objective is to generate a syllabus for the given textbook by leveraging the seed knowledge graph aided hierarchical classification method.
